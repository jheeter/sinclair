##Sinclair

Sinclair aims to create an easy-to-use, multi-media, responsively designed template for online news packages. Based on Javascript with heavy use of CSS, Sinclair allows multimedia objects to be incorporated on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis with text.

The project was pioneered by Lazaro Gamio with The Miami Herald. It's now an official project of The McClatchy Company, which is aiming to create a user-friendly template that can be used by McClatchy properties and other organizations which follow the open MIT license.

The Miami Herald has made significant use of Sinclair. The first use of Sinclair outside Miami was [The Telegraph of Macon's "Nine Funerals" package](http://www.macon.com/static/media/projects/nine-funerals/). The goal is to make this project more usable, and more often used.
