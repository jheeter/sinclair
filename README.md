###Sinclair

Sinclair aims to create an easy-to-use, multi-media, responsively designed template for online news packages. Based on Javascript with heavy use of CSS, Sinclair allows multimedia objects to be incorporated on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis with text.

The project was pioneered by Lazaro Gamio with The Miami Herald. It's now an official project of The McClatchy Company, which is aiming to create a user-friendly template that can be used by McClatchy properties and other organizations which follow the open MIT license.

The Miami Herald has made significant use of Sinclair. The first use of Sinclair outside Miami was [The Telegraph of Macon's "Nine Funerals" package](http://www.macon.com/static/media/projects/nine-funerals/). The goal is to make this project more usable, and more often used.

###Origins of the name

The fine folks at the Chicago Tribune's news apps team named [one of their apps after Ida Tarbell](http://tarbell.tribapps.com/), a muckraking journalist. It would be easy and wrong to assume this app is named after Upton Sinclair, author of "The Jungle."

[The Miami Herald explored the long, strange history of the name Peter B. Sinclair](http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/06/04/3431537/peter-b-sinclair-the-miami-herald.html) in a way that must be fully read to be appreciated.
