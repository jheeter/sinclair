Based on Javascript with heavy use of CSS, Sinclair allows multimedia objects to be incorporated on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis with text. The project was pioneered by Lazaro Gamio with The Miami Herald. It's now an official project of The McClatchy Company, which is aiming to create a user-friendly template that can be used by McClatchy properties and other organizations which follow the open MIT license.",
